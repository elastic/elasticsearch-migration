== Elasticsearch Migration Plugin v0.13

This plugin will help you to check whether you can upgrade directly to
Elasticsearch version 2.x, or whether you need to make changes to your data
before doing so. It will run on Elasticsearch versions 0.90.x to 1.x.

NOTE: Checks are limited only to data that is stored in the cluster, such as
cluster and index settings, mappings, and segments. It does not take settings
files or your use of the API into account. *You should still test your
application thoroughly and backup your data before upgrading.*

Each check is given a color, whose meaning is as follows:

Green::  All OK.
Blue::   An advisory note that something has changed. No action needed.
Yellow:: You can upgrade directly, but you are using deprecated functionality which will not be
         available in version 2.x.
Red::    You cannot upgrade without fixing this problem.

Changes] documentation online.

=== Installation

To install, run the following command in your Elasticsearch home directory:

[source,sh]
---------------
./bin/plugin -i elastic/elasticsearch-migration
---------------

Then open the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:9200/_plugin/migration

=== Checking a remote cluster

The migration tool can run checks against a remote Elasticsearch cluster, as long
as the cluster has https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-http.html[CORS enabled and properly configured].

As a minimum, you will need to set the following in `elasticsearch.yml`:

[source,yaml]
-----
http.cors.enabled:      true
http.cors.allow-origin: # the hostname or a regex which matches the hostname
-----

If you use basic AUTH, you will also need to tick the `Enable basic AUTH support` checkbox and add this setting to `elasticsearch.yml`:

[source,yaml]
-----
http.cors.allow-credentials: true
-----

=== Checks performed

This plugin will check cluster settings and each index for the following:

* *Cluster settings*:
** Use of byte or time settings without units.

* *Index segments*:
** Segments created by Lucene 3, which cannot be read by Elasticsearch 2.x.
** Indices created before 0.90 which no longer have Lucene 3 segments, but
   which require a setting to mark them as 2.x compatible.

* *Index settings*:
** In memory indices, which are no longer supported.
** The `index.mapping.allow_type_wrapper` setting.
** Custom codecs
** Use of "default_index" analyzer
** Use of byte or time settings without units.
** Use of deprecated merge policy settings.
** Use of the `index.buffer_size` setting.

* *Type mapping*:
** Type mapping name length < 256
** Type names with initial dot
** Custom configured `_id` field.
** Custom configured `_type` field.
** Use of an `_analyer` field.
** Use of the `_boost` field.
** Custom configured `_routing` field.
** Custom configured `_index` field.
** Use of `_size` field.
** Custom configured `_timestamp` field.
** Use of type-level default analyzer settings.
** Use of reserved field names.

* *Field mapping*:
** Fields with the same name in different types with conflicting mappings.
** Use of the `index_name` or `path` settings.
** Boolean fields, whose field value has changed from `T`/`F` to `1`/`0`.
** Custom postings formats.
** Compressed binary fields.
** Fielddata formats.
** Field names with embedded periods.
** Fields with a `search_analyzer` but no `analyzer` or `index_analyzer`
** Use of `position_offset_gap`.
** Use of murmur3 fields.

=== Test suite

Two test suites are available:

http://localhost:9200/_plugin/migration/test.html::

Tests all checks except the index segments checks. No setup required.

http://localhost:9200/_plugin/migration/test_index_segments.html::

Tests the index segments checks.  Requires a pre-existing `data/` directory which is packaged
with this plugin.  Follow the instructions on the test suite page.
